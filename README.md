An intelligent book recommendation engine that provides nuanced suggestions by combining a user's text query, desired genre, and emotional tone.

## ‚ú® About The Project

This project leverages modern NLP techniques to create a multi-faceted recommendation system that understands user intent with high precision. Unlike traditional recommenders, it uses a three-stage refinement process to deliver results that match a user's specific mood and interests.

The system's workflow is as follows:

1.  **Semantic Search:** A user's text query is converted into a vector embedding using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model. This vector is then used to perform a high-speed similarity search against a pre-indexed **Chroma** vector database of book descriptions.

2.  **Categorical Filtering:** The initial list of semantically similar books is then filtered based on the user's selected genre (e.g., 'Fiction', 'Nonfiction').

3.  **Emotional Tone Sorting:** Finally, the filtered results are sorted based on the user's desired emotional tone (e.g., 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Thriller/Fearful'). This unique final step ensures that the most emotionally relevant books appear first.

The entire application is wrapped in a clean, interactive **Gradio** dashboard for a seamless user experience.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the **7k Books with Metadata** dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata)

The necessary data files, such as `books_sentiment.csv` and `tagged_description.txt` etc, are generated from this source dataset by running the preprocessing notebooks included in this repository.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/vishwamohansinghnegi/books-recommender.git](https://github.com/vishwamohansinghnegi/books-recommender.git)
    cd books-recommender
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download the dataset:**
    * Download the `7k-books-with-metadata` dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata).
    * Unzip the file and place the `books.csv` file inside a `data/` directory in the project root.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

Before launching the app, you must first process the raw data.

1.  **Run the Preprocessing Notebooks:**
    * Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (`vector_search.ipynb` and `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`) in order.
    * These notebooks will clean the data, perform sentiment analysis, and generate the essential `books_sentiment.csv` and `tagged_description.txt` files required by the application.

2.  **Launch the Gradio Dashboard:**
    * Once the data files are generated, run the dashboard script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python gradio_dashboard.py
    ```
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

3.  **Get Recommendations:**
    * Input your query, select a category and tone, and click the "Find recommendations" button!
